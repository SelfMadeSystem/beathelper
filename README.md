# Beat Helper

A simple web app to help you practice your rhythm game skills. It displays falling circles in one or more columns, each associated with a specific key and BPM (beats per minute). Your goal is to press the corresponding key as the circles reach the bottom of the column, testing your timing and accuracy.

Built with React and TypeScript, and bundled with [Bun](https://bun.sh).
